### Webhooks  

Webhooks are like having a helpful assistant who proactively notifies your application when important notarization events occur. Instead of repeatedly asking, “Has the notarization been completed?”, webhooks automatically tap your application on the shoulder when it happens.

### Why use webhooks?

- **Real-time updates**: Get instant notifications when notarization events are completed.  
- **Automation friendly**: Perfect for integrating notarization workflows seamlessly.  
- **Efficient**: No need to constantly poll the API for updates.  
- **Reliable**: Never miss an important event, even if your system is temporarily down.

### Getting started  

To start receiving webhooks from Platus, follow these steps:  

1. Set up a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint on your server.  
2. Register your webhook URL with Platus (via your dashboard under `/webhooks`).  
3. Implement a handler to process the `notarization.completed` event.  


<Tip>
**Tip**: While not required, we highly recommend validating webhook signatures to ensure that the events originate from Platus.
