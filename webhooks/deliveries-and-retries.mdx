title: 'Delivery & Retries'
---

When your server receives a webhook, it's like getting a handshake from Platus. To confirm you received it:

* Your endpoint should respond with **HTTP status code 200 OK** or **201 Created**.

* If your server fails to respond, we will retry delivery up to **20 times** using **exponential backoff** to avoid overwhelming your system.

### Best Practices

Handle Platus webhooks like a pro by following these best practices:

* **Make handlers idempotent**: Ensure receiving the same webhook multiple times doesn't cause unintended effects.

* **Validate webhook signatures**: Verify the event's authenticity to ensure it originates from Platus.

* **Respond quickly**: Acknowledge receipt promptly to prevent retries.
