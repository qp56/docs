### Webhook payload example  

Here’s an example of the webhook payload you’ll receive for a completed notarization:  

```json
{
  "webhook_id": "webhook_abcdef123456",
  "event": "notarization.completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-18T12:00:00Z",
  "case": "notarization",
  "case_id": "evt_123456",
  "document_id": "doc_123456",
  "document_url": "https://api.platus.com/documents/document123456.pdf",
  "document_hash": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "client_reference": "REF-2024-001",
  "client_postback_url": "https://client-domain.com/webhook-endpoint"
}
```

## Webhook delivery & retries  

When your server receives a webhook, it’s like getting a handshake from Platus. To confirm you received it:  

- Your endpoint should respond with **HTTP status code 200 OK** or **201 Created**.  
- If your server fails to respond, we will retry delivery up to **20 times** using **exponential backoff** to avoid overwhelming your system.  

## Best practices  

Handle Platus webhooks like a pro by following these best practices:  

- **Make handlers idempotent**: Ensure receiving the same webhook multiple times doesn’t cause unintended effects.  
- **Validate webhook signatures**: Verify the event’s authenticity to ensure it originates from Platus.  
- **Respond quickly**: Acknowledge receipt promptly to prevent retries.
