title: "Delivery & Retries"
---

When your server receives a webhook, it's like getting a handshake from Beglaubigt. To confirm you received it:

- Your endpoint should respond with **HTTP status code 200 OK** or **201 Created**.
- If your server fails to respond, we will retry delivery up to **5 times** using **exponential backoff** to avoid overwhelming your system.

  | Number of retry | Backoff time |
  | --------------- | ------------ |
  | 1               | 2 minutes    |
  | 2               | 4 minutes    |
  | 3               | 8 minutes    |
  | 4               | 16 minutes   |
  | 5               | 32 minutes   |

### Best Practices

Handle Beglaubigt webhooks like a pro by following these best practices:

- **Make handlers idempotent**: Ensure receiving the same webhook multiple times doesn't cause unintended effects.
- **Validate webhook signatures**: Verify the event's authenticity to ensure it originates from Beglaubigt.
- **Respond quickly**: Acknowledge receipt promptly to prevent retries.
